# Open OnDemand Main Page

## Toolbar

To access all of the features OOD has to offer, use the toolbar at the top of the page that looks like:

![!Toolbar for Open OnDemand.](./images/ood_toolbar.png)

In it, you will find options to:

   1. Directly access your files on Cheaha
   2. View currently running jobs
   3. Interface with Cheaha via a shell terminal
   4. Request interactive sessions

To use a shell terminal in Cheaha through OOD, click `Clusters >> >_Cheaha Shell Access`. You can use this exactly like a standard `ssh` tunnel.

!!! warning

    Using the shell terminal in this way puts you on the login node. Do not run any compute tasks on the login node. Request a compute node first!
